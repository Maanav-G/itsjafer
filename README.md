I'm a student at the University of Waterloo and Wilfrid Laurier University currently interning at Amazon as a Software Development Engineer. I'm also actively searching for a summer 2021 internship for my senior year :-)

I'd love for you to visit my [website](itsjafer.com), play the networking game with me on [LinkedIn](linkedin.com/in/itsjafer), or just [shoot me an email](mailto:itsjafer@gmail.com) asking about my experiences! 

If you've read this far and you play Rocket League, please send me a message -- I really need someone to carry me to champ.
